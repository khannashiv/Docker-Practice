## MERN stack application implementation.

- Project Overview : This project uses the MERN stack, which stands for:

    M: MongoDB (Database Layer)
    E: Express.js (Application Logic Layer)
    R: React.js (Frontend/UI Layer)
    N: Node.js (Runtime Environment for Backend)

There are two branches in the project:
 - main branch: Provided by the developers, contains the original source code.
 - compose branch: Derived from main, enhanced to support containerization using Docker and Docker Compose.

ðŸ”— Reference : GitHub Repo - MERN Docker Compose : https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/MERN-docker-compose/tree/main 

**Role of Each Component**

 - MongoDB: Stores application data. It's the database used by the backend.
 - Express.js: Backend web application framework where business logic resides.
 - Node.js: Executes the Express.js application and serves API endpoints.
 - React.js: The frontend that interacts with users and consumes APIs from the backend.

**General Interpretation.**

| Language | Dependency File    |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Python   | `requirements.txt` |
| Java     | `pom.xml`          |
| Node.js  | `package.json`     |
| Go       | `go.mod`           |

**Dockerization Workflow**

- Create a Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend.
- Set up a custom Docker network so containers can talk to each other.
- Run all Docker commands manually to test individual services.
- Once confirmed, migrate to a single file: docker-compose.yaml.

**Docker Compose simplifies**

- Multi-container orchestration
- Network configuration
- Volume management
- Dependency ordering (e.g., DB before backend)

**Important Notes**

- Firstly we have confgured, frontend container.
- Then we configure and start the MongoDB container first, before one tries to configure backend container since backend container tries to connect the database/mongodb container via connection string on startup.
- Make sure containers are on the same Docker network for hostname-based resolution.
- Use Docker volumes to persist MongoDB data.

#### Docker Commands for Manual Testing

 **List commands**
  - docker network ls
  - docker images
  - docker volume ls

**Docker build commands**
- docker build -t khannashiv/mern-frontend:v1 ./frontend
- docker build -t khannashiv/mern-backend:v1 ./backend

**Docker create commands**
- docker network create mern-app-network

**Docker run commands**
- docker run -dit --name=mongodb --network=mern-app-network -v /opt/mongo-db-data/:/opt/data -p 27017:27017 mongo:8.0
- docker run -dit --name=mern-stack-backend --network=mern-app-network -p 5050:5050 khannashiv/mern-backend:v1
- docker run -dit --name=mern-stack-frontend --network=mern-app-network -p 5173:5173 khannashiv/mern-frontend:v1

**Docker container logs**
- docker logs mongodb
- docker logs mern-stack-backend
- docker logs mern-stack-frontend

**Docker exec commands**
- docker exec -it mongodb /bin/bash
- docker exec -it mern-stack-backend /bin/bash
- docker exec -it mern-stack-frontend /bin/bash

**Docker rm commands**
- docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
- docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)

- Once we have confirmed everything worked locally, we have stop all containers, followed by deleting them and also we have deleted their correspoding docker images.
- Next we have created a compose.yml file which will container all the services i.e. frontend, backend as well as db conatiners all in single YAML file.
- Final outcomes of the project has been attached below in the form of snaps.
